## Overview of the analysis

As many college-aged millennials know, Tinder is a popular online dating app where you swipe **_left_** if you don’t like someone, **_right_** if you do, or **_up_** if you want to “super like” them and show you already "liked" them. Both users must like each other and “match” to be able to start a conversation.

This dataset includes students from colleges throughout the country, but for this project we will focus on the data from colleges in California by cleaning and organizing the data for each school. Eventually, we will get the overall percent of relationship success rate from millennials in California who use Tinder, which then brings us to the purpose of this analysis. The purpose of this analysis is to compare the overall success rate of millennials in colleges around the United States who use Tinder and compare it to the overall Tinder success rate for millennials from colleges in California based on whether or not it "_**became a relationship**_."

## Conclusion
Overall, this analysis shows the average success rate on whether it became a relationship or not among millennials. It looks at the overall average results from millennials from some colleges around the United States who use Tinder and later we compare it to the average overall results from millennials from California colleges. According to these pie charts shown below, the overall results from millennials **NOT** in California colleges are about the same as the results we got when we only looked at the data from millennials from California colleges. Millennials from colleges in California still tend to have a slightly higher dating app success rate according to our data.

For future analysis, to improve this analysis and get a more accurate way to analyze this data, I would try to look for data where the **_sample size_** is the same for **_each_** college. That would help make a less biased answer if we ever decide to judge the results by each college. For example, you can see some colleges, such as Stanford University had 108 millennials surveyed, while other colleges like University of California, San Diego only had 1 millennial surveyed in this dataset. The difference in sample size shows it would be difficult to compare these two colleges together. The results from Stanford University would be more accurate in this example mentioned because the sample size was larger and had a bigger variety of millennials surveyed.

**Overall Results from Millennials in All US Colleges**

<img width="369" alt="Average overall results colleges" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79742633/137049777-cd4c8015-1f45-4704-88c0-585bb8f8164d.png">

This data shows there are a **28.70%** chance of a "**Yes**" result and a **71.30%** chance of a "**No**" result for the overall average when looking at all colleges in the United States we looked at from this dataset.

**Overall Results from Millennials in California Colleges**

<img width="366" alt="CA Colleges Tinder Success Rate" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79742633/148360716-4e939ce9-e883-444e-af53-22ecdc6acbd0.png">

This data shows there are **30.56%** chance of a "**Yes**" result, meaning that it became a relationship and was successful. It also shows a **69.44%** for the "**No**" results for these millennials, meaning that it did not become a relationship and was **NOT** successful. Since the data of the "**Yes**" results are higher than the overall average results in the US, this can mean millennials in **California colleges** may have a slightly higher chance of finding a relationship compared to millennials in colleges outside of California.
