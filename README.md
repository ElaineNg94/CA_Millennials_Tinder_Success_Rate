## Overview of the analysis

As many college-aged millennials know, Tinder is a popular online dating app where you swipe left if you don’t like someone, right if you do, or up if you want 
to “super like” them and show you already "liked" them. Both users must like each other and “match” to be able to start a conversation. This dataset includes
students from colleges throughout the country, but for this project we will focus on the data from colleges in California by cleaning and organizing the data 
for each school. Eventually, we will get the overall percentage of relationship success rate from millennials in California who use Tinder.

## Average results by college/university
**University of California, Davis**

**University of California, Berkeley**

**Santa Clara University**

**Stanford University**

**University of California, Santa Cruz**

**Cal Poly San Luis Obispo**

**University of California, Santa Barbara**

**Cal State Northridge**

**University of California, Los Angeles**

**University of Southern California**

## Conclusion
Overall, this analysis shows the average success rate on whether it became a relationship or not among millennials in all colleges in the United States on tinder. According to this pie chart, the results are about the same as the results we got when we only looked at millennials from California colleges.
