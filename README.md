## Overview of the analysis

As many college-aged millennials know, Tinder is a popular online dating app where you swipe left if you don’t like someone, right if you do, or up if you
want to “super like” them and show you already "liked" them. Both users must like each other and “match” to be able to start a conversation. This dataset
includes students from colleges throughout the country, but for this project we will focus on the data from colleges in California by cleaning and organizing
the data for each school. Eventually, we will get the overall percentage of relationship success rate from millennials in California who use Tinder, which
brings us to the purpose of this analysis. The purpose of this analysis is to compare the overall success rate from millennials in colleges around the United States and comparing it to the overall success rate for millennials from colleges in California on whether or not it "_**became a relationship**_."

## Conclusion
Overall, this analysis shows the average success rate on whether it became a relationship or not among millennials in all colleges in the United States on
Tinder. According to these pie charts shown below, the overall results from millennials **NOT** in California colleges are about the same as the results we
got when we only looked at millennials from California colleges.
